# space-invaders

This was a recreation of the original Atari game of Space Invaders. This project was written in Python, using the PyCharm IDE. 
This project was meant to be a recreation of Space Invaders, but more closely resembles the project before this one, Alien Invasion, 
which was used as somewhat of a template to create this project. This was one of my first exposures to using Python, and I'm happy with the 
result despite how simple the game appears.

============================================================================== 

Works

-Player can control the ship; they can move left, right, and shoot.

-Aliens approach the player similarly to the way they do in Space Invaders. They slowly come down and increase speed as the player progresses throughout the game.

-Score tracking works

-Player ship can be destroyed upon contact with an alien. Player can also lose a limited number of lives and the game restarts as a result

==============================================================================

Doesn't Really Work

-Title screen not present

-Animations leave a bit to be desired

-Extra features such as: 

  o Enemies shooting back
  
  o Destructable cover for the player to hide under 
  
  o Bonus alien ship spawning and scrolling by
  
were not implemented
